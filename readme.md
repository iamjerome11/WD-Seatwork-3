## Rules, Practices and Principles
1. Always use `WD-` in the front of the Title of the Project for the Subject followed by your custom naming.
2. Do not rename any .html files; always use `index.html` as the filename.
3. Place files in their respective folders.
4. All file naming is in camel case.
   - Camel case is a naming format where there is no white space in the separation of each word; the first word is all lowercase while the succeeding words' first letters are uppercase followed by lowercase letters.
   - ex.: `buttonAnimatedStyle.css`
5. Use only `External CSS`.
6. Renaming of Pages folder names is a must and should relate to what it is doing or the data it holds.
7. File Structure to follow below.
